### Thesis

#### Locality Sensitive Hashing based Techniques for Inner Product Similarity
In this work we explored the usage of hash based techniques for inner product similarity estimation. Locality sensitive hashing is one of them that hashes similar objects into thesame location with high probability. We used this technique to retrieve frequent patterns by incorporating it into Apriori algorithm.
