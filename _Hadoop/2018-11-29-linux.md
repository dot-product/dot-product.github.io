## Fstab entries are not added

    - List all disks with the types 

    - create pysical volumes

    - create logical volumes

    - format lvs with proper fs type(ex4 etc)

    - mount these lvs at different mount points

    - This mounting is not persistent as we did not add any entries to fstab. When the box is rebooted these mounts are gone!

    sudo pvcreate /dev/sdm
	sudo vgcreate hdfs_archival_1 /dev/sdm
	sudo lvcreate -l 100%FREE -n hdfs_archival_1_lvm hdfs_archival_1
	sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/hdfs_archival_1/hdfs_archival_1_lvm
	sudo mkdir  /m_archival_1
	sudo mount /dev/hdfs_archival_1/hdfs_archival_1_lvm /m_archival_1
	/dev/mapper/hdfs_archival_1-hdfs_archival_1_lvm /m_archival_1 ext4
