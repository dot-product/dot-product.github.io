	- /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/unique-process-name contains role specific configurations.

	-  **Gateway** It is used to deploy a client configuration to a host that does not have a role assigned to it.

### Process Management

	- In cloudera manager managed cluster, you can only star or stop role instance processes using cloudera manager.

	- Cloudera manager uses process management tool called **supervisord**.

	- Agent is started by init.d script.

	- When the Agent detects a new process from the Server heartbeat, the Agent creates a directory for it in **/var/run/cloudera-scm-agent** and unpacks the configuration. It then contacts **supervisord,** which starts the process.
