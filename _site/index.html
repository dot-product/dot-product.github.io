    <h2 id="science">Science</h2>

<p>Science (from Latin scientia, meaning “knowledge”) is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>								(OR)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Knowledge about or study of the natural world based on facts learned through experiments and observation.</p>

<h2 id="computer-science">Computer Science</h2>

<p>Computer science is the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It involves the study of algorithms that process, store, and communicate digital information.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>								(OR)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Computer Science encompasses both the study of theoretical algorithms and the practical problems involved in implementing them through computer hardware and software.</p>

<h2 id="engineering">Engineering</h2>

<p>Engineering is the creative application of science, mathematical methods, and empirical evidence to the innovation, design, construction, operation and maintenance of structures, machines, materials, devices, systems, processes, and organizations for the benefit of humankind.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>								(OR)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Engineering is the application of scientific knowledge to solving problems in the real world. While science (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.) allows us to gain an understanding of the World and the Universe, Engineering enables this understanding to come to life through problem solving, designing and building things.</p>

<h2 id="research">Research</h2>

<p>Research comprises “creative and systematic work undertaken to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of humans, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.”</p>
