## Terminology

- Resource Manager(RM)
    - Scheduler, ApllicationsManager
- Node Manager(NM)
- Application Master(AM)
- Resources(Memeroy and vcores)
- Containers
- Applications

## Fair Scheduler

- by default, bases scheduling fairness decisions only on memory.
- dominat Resource Fairness
- priorities - These are used as weights to determine the fraction of total resources that each app should get.
- 
#### queues
- Scheduler organizes apps further into "queues"
- Queues can be arranged in a hierarchy to divide resources and configured with weights to share the cluster in specific proportions.
- The Fair Scheduler allows assigning guaranteed minimum shares to queues, which is useful for ensuring that certain users, groups or production applications always get sufficient resources
- FairShare is simply an amount of YARN cluster resources. We will use the notation <memory: 100GB, vcores: 25> to indicate a FairShare of 100GB and 25 vcores.
- Min/Max resource constraints( It is not recommanded )
- fairSharePreemptionThreshold
- fairSharePreemptionTimeout

#### Preemption configs

- yarn.scheduler.fair.preemption == true
- yarn.scheduler.fair.preemption.cluster-utilization-threshold, default value is 80%
