## Terminology

- Broker
- Topic

- Producer, Consumer
- controller, zombie controller, epoch number (also called a fencing token)
- Mirror Maker


## Meta Data, what is it in kafka?

- Persistent, replicated, append only write ahead log. 
- Kafka persists its data on disk linearly. Reads and writes are constant time O(1).
- leader replica info is stored in zookeeper, consumer offsets are stored in kafka itself.
- you can increase replication factor but you can not increase partition count.

## Important Configurations

- replica.lag.time.max.ms
- zookeeper.session.timeout.ms
- acks=all, which means that the leader broker will only acknowledge messages once all the in-sync followers (ISRs) have successfully replicated the messages themselves. 

## Write(produce), Read(consume) operations
